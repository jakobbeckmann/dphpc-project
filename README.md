# dphpc-project
Group work for the Design of Parallel and High Performance Computing course 2017  

## How-To
Compile using cmake and run dphpc_project.exe.  

## Visualization
Run AnimationWrapper.py script.  
Specify whether you want to save or play the movie and whether you want to see the index labels. 
Everything is build with relative paths so you don't have to specify anything else, the python scripts picks the correct output files from the last run to render and deletes the ones which are not needed anymore (old runs with higher number of output files for example).
